        <h2>My Bio</h2><p>Hey there! I'm a 25-year-old currently navigating the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) journey, armed with a BSc
            in Computer Science from the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN). Living it up in Lagos, I'm all about tech
            innovation, especially diving into the cloud engineering scene. Whether I'm gaming, solving puzzles, or exploring
            the exciting world of coding, I'm the second-to-last child in a lively family of seven. Just recently decided to
            take this cloud engineering thing seriously, and I'm stoked to bring some fresh vibes to the tech world. Let's see
            where this cloud adventure takes me! ðŸš€ðŸ’»</p>

        <h2>Reasons for Joining Alt School</h2>
        <p>Jumping into the tech gig is like grabbing a backstage pass to the tech party! Why? Well, tech
            is always doing its thing, and right now, the cloud is the place to be. Imagine soaking up the latest in cloud
            wizardryâ€”all from the couch or wherever. Online learning lets me do the brainy stuff without turning life upside
            down. Plus, it's not just theory; I'll be diving into real cloud projects. The online setup means I'm not flying
            solo; there's a whole gang and cool interactive stuff to keep it lively at AltSchool. And, let's keep it real, in a world where
            the wallet can feel a bit skinny, learning cloud engineering is my way of dodging the <strong>Sapa</strong> and locking in a
            future in the tech scene!ðŸš€.</p>

        <h2>My Goals for Alt School</h2>
        <p>As an aspiring cloud engineer with a computer science background, I'm on a mission to master AWS, Azure, and
            Google
            Cloudâ€”because alphabet soup is part of the tech diet, right? I'm juggling serious goals, like building
            skills in
            virtualization, networking, and security, with a touch of humor (yes, Python lets me talk to snakes).
            Strengthening
            my foundation in algorithms is like building the ultimate code castle. I'm actively participating in tech
            communities, seeking internships for a digital quest, and financially planning for my tech treasure chest.
            Mentorship is my tech wizardry guide, and giving back includes sharing both experiences and the occasional
            tech-related joke. Here's to coding, cloud dreams, and laughter along the way!</p>
